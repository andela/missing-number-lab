You are present with two arrays, all containing positive integers.

One of the arrays will have one extra number, see below

`[1,2,3]` and `[1,2,3,4]` should return 4

`[4,66,7]` and `[66,77,7,4]` should return 77

## Instructions

Remember that passing code is just the first step. The goal is to work
towards a solution that is as readable and expressive as you can make
it.

Please make your solution as general as possible. Good code doesn't just
pass the test suite, it works with any input that fits the
specification.

Have fun!
